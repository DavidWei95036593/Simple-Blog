	<h1>Read Me</h1>
	<p>The purpose of this assignment is to combine the knowledge we learn on Monday with part one of the homework. In this assignment, I used previous notes for tabs and previous code strucure as well as google font to make my three secions fonts look nice. I also searched HTML Color Names to get a list of colors in order to decide which color I'll use for each section. Also I'd like to acknowledge Jeremy Xu who shares his idea with me and we were able to come up with new thoughts for making this Blog better. For example, we discussed how to prevent user to post empty blog and warn them not to. In my code, although I prevent the user to post empty blog, I failed to put a new line that contains context to ask them not to post empty blog, the warnning line would appear every time the user trys to post an empty blog and won't disappear when the user post a actual blog </p>

	<div class="description">
	<p>Fried chicken (also referred to as Southern fried chicken for the variant in the United States) is a dish consisting of chicken pieces usually from broiler chickens which have been floured or battered and then pan-fried, deep fried, or pressure fried. The breading adds a crisp coating or crust to the exterior. What separates fried chicken from other fried forms of chicken is that generally the chicken is cut at the joints, and the bones and skin are left intact. Crisp well-seasoned skin, rendered of excess fat, is a hallmark of well made fried chicken.</p>
